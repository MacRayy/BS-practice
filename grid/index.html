			<p>Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.</p>
			<p>Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back. Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long. Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?</p>
			<p>You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack</p>
			<p>Easy, Chewie. Whoa! Whoa! Help! Chewie, you okay? Where is he? I'm okay, pal. Han! Chewie? Lando! Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where? Lando, grab it! Lower it! I'm trying! Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! Hold it! Whoa! Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. No, wait! I thought you were blind! It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!</p>
			<p>Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.</p>
